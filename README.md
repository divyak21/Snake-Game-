# Snake-Game-
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java. The game follows the classic concept where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.
Features
The snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.
Food appears randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
The score is displayed on the screen, indicating the number of food items eaten.
The game speed increases as the snake grows longer, providing an added challenge.
Technologies Used
The Snake Game is implemented using the following technologies:

Java: The programming language used to write the game logic.
Swing: The Java GUI toolkit used to create the game's graphical user interface.
Object-Oriented Programming: The game is structured using classes and objects to manage different aspects of the game.
How to Play
Run the game by executing the SnakeGame.java file.
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the snake's movement.
Try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's body or the game boundaries.
The game ends if the snake collides, and your score will be displayed.
Future Improvements
The Snake Game can be further enhanced with the following features:

High scores: Implement a high-score system to keep track of the best scores achieved.
Levels: Add different levels of difficulty, adjusting the speed and complexity of the game.
Power-ups: Introduce power-up items that provide temporary advantages or additional challenges.
Multiplayer mode: Allow multiple players to compete or collaborate in the same game session.
